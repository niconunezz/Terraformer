# Terraformer
Here you have a code that takes data from arduino, and with it, it makes 6 real-time graphics, it represent cordinates on google earth by creating an real-time kml file, and finally it represent all the data in an excell table(I also include de arduino code, same important as the python one)

# Try it
You have two 'terraformer' codes, the first one works without the arduino code, his data is randonmly created, you just need to download it and execute it. The 'Terraformer(2)' one, needs the arduino file working, there you can see the actual project, but for the arduino code to work you need some arduino stuff, like the bmp.
